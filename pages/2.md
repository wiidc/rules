## 2. No Spam
### Intro 
This is one of our simpler rules.

- Bots that serve no real function and annoy users. We allow very few unsolicited posting bots. Bots that people activate, such as the ‘remindme’ bot, we usually leave alone.
- Posts that are selling something or gratuitously advertising something.
- Anything off-topic.

## Questions?
- If you have questions regarding the rules or bans, please feel free to message the moderators via mail at **wiidc@proton.me**
