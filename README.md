## Removal From the Community
We reserve the right to remove anyone from our community for any or no reason with no explanation on any platform we currently occupy.

We will correct misunderstandings, we will not argue how we enforce our rules. If you have an issue with it, please take it up with the platform management that you have the complaint on.

## Removals, Kicks, Bans and Circumventing
- Any rule violation can result in your post being removed, or you being banned depending on the context of the violation.
- Continually violating a rule will get you banned.
- All spambots will be banned permanently when found by a moderator.
- All bans, even perma-bans will be periodically evaluated. So no ban is truly permanent.
